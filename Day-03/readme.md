## Class Details

* Office Hours: Tuesdays at 3pm, NSH 186
* Today's material is at 
    - `nd.edu/~brose3/2018reu-cmp/Day03.zip`

---

# Goals

1. ~~Be able to use `git`'s `pull`, `add`, `commit`, and `push` commands~~
2. Be able to use `while` and `for` loops
3. Be able to import and manipulate text or data from a file

---

# From last time...

* `if`, `elif`, `else` blocks
* What are lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries?
    * How to use sets
    * How to call a dictionary by key
* How would you check if a variable is a list?
    - is a int, or float or string
* Imutable

---

# ~~Git~~

* `pull` from Classroom
* change `change_this_file.txt`
* `add` and `commit` changes
* `push` to your own remote repository

---

# Loops

---

## `while`

Basic structure:

```python
while condition is True:
    do_something()
    update_condition()
```

- condition can be anything that returns a *boolean* (usually math-related)
- without update, infinite loop

---

## `for`

Basic structure:

```python
for item in container:
    do_something_with(item)
```

- container is an *iterable* (list, tuple, string, or *generator*)
- if you just want numbers, use `range`

# File Input/Output (I/O)

We will only get to file input today.

---

## String detour

* `s.strip()`
* `s.split()`
* `int(s)`
* `float(s)`
* `\n`

---

## Filenames -- UNIX

* `.` is current directory or folder
* `..` is the directory above
* `/` to separate directories

---

## Basic file reading

```python
f = open(filename, 'r')
f.read()
f.close()
```

---

## Better file reading

```python
with open(filename, 'r') as f:
    f.read()
```

There is also a very useful `.readline()` method that reads one line at a time instead of the whole file at once.

---

## "Best" file reading

```python
import csv

with open(filename, 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(
        f, delimiter=',')
    next(reader)
```

*Note*: `numpy` and other packages will be even better, but lets walk before we run.

# Practice Time!

- Practice with the handout
- Import `northwind.txt` then separate by word
    + Try to count how many times each word appears
- Calculate the average sunspot form `sunspots.txt` 
    + Can you count the days who's number of sunspots fell with an arbitrary range?

*Readings* - nothing new, just catch up if you need to.
